##concept

Create your own instrument, combine trumpet, keyboard, guitar, flute, harp and drums in one single experience for your own creativity.This is a concept project, realization will take money and some time. you might have seen projects like laser harp or stuff, but most lack the haptic feedback experience or are extremely expensive new instruments.

##how

3D printing has not yet entered fully the musical instrument. Many instrument makers base their designs on the physical properties of instruments but new manufacturing methods and electronics maybe combined in a zillion ways. Small modules representing the interaction part of the instrument (holes, strings, drumpads) contain the sensors, all freely combinable (with magnets or clips) by a network and controlled by your smartdevice.

##needed
Electronic guy, 3-D product design key, prototypers, instrumentalists,app developer


##module ideas

Here some modules with their relative counterpart of traditional instruments (if applicable)


| Instrument part|what/how      | sensordata
|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------
| string strum   | short string | direction, position and strength
| trumpet        | ventil       | z-depth, speed movement in x-y
| flute          | hole         | coverage, floating, movement x-y
| strip          |              | capacitive position
| air flow       |              | speed and direction (in/out)
| string + frets |              | (guitar style with x-y movement detection and pressure)
| drum pad       |              | different size, position sensitivity
| kalimba        |              | speed only (or hold and bend?)
| shake          |              | accel:(x-y-z), pressure (or piggy pack pressure module?)
| bagpipe        | bag          | combined with airflow (immagine a guitar fretboard with bagpipe)
| drone module   | potentiometer| level
| rumble pack    |              | haptic feedback

- These modules should somehow fit together (magnet style like Mac power supply).
- Wireless module for datatransmission.
- Can bus (or similar) on modules


### combined ideas for pitching ###

bagpipe with guitar fretboard
harp with pitchmodules
air guitar
pitch drums
shake flute (4 flute holes + shake), 2 different modules combined together
